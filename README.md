# DTP3-Project-2025
For the Waka Ama National Games. A program that computes what each regional association should place according to the points they should be awarded for their placings.

HOW TO RUN:
Download all files below:
GUI.py
calculate_points.py
file_reading.py
display_results.py

Ensure you have downloaded the WakaNats folder. In file_reading.py you can change the directory in which the WakaNats subdirectory belongs to, by changing the folder_path variable at line 11 (exclude 'str(target_year)'). Ensure you have also downloaded the proper third-party Python libraries; customtkinter & tkinter.

Run the program from display_results.py. Read the instructions. After you have entered a valid Waka Ama year to analyze and a valid number of maximum points and press the analyze button, close the window and you will see the results window.

The highest place gets the most points, and each subsequent lower place gets 1 less point. (Example: 1st place gets 10pts, 2nd gets 9pts, 3rd gets 8pts, etc.)
